    "# Analysis of Purchase History of Heroes Of Pymoli \n",
    "## Abstract\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "Heroes of Pymoli (HOP) is the latest game released by an independent gaming company. It follows the free-to-play (F2P) revenue model, which is intended to attract larger gaming audiences and to address their willingness-to-pay (WTP) for additional gaming experience-enhancing features (Alha et al., 2014). There are 183 optional items on offer with HOP, ranging from USD 1.00 to USD 4.99. Motivations for purchasing these items could be any of the following reasons: (1) unobstructed play; (2) social interaction; (3) competition; (4) economical rationale; (5) indulging children; and unlocking content (Hamari et al., 2017). \n",
    "\n",
    "This study was aimed to describe the demographics who play HOP and their purchase of the optional items. The motivations for purchase, however, was not explored in this study."

    "## Materials and Methods\n",
    "The dataset used in this study was extracted information provided by players of HOP who bought optional items to enhance their gaming experience. Each player was identified by his/her screen name (SN) but real names were excluded. The dataset includes the gender and the age of each gamer. The items each gamer purchased and their unit prices were also indicated. \n",
    "\n",
    "Data analyses were conducted using Python (version 3.6), primarily using Pandas (McKinney 2010) and NumPy (Oliphant 2006). Summary statistics were obtained and presented. "

    "There are a total of 576 players with unique SNs who purchased HOP optional items. These players can be assumed to make 5% of the total population of HOP gamers, but these people who have expressed their WTPs might very well be the gaming company's major income generators, just like in other companies (Thubron 2017). The rest of the players (95%), those who did not purchase any of the optional items, were virtually contractors of the game company; they were \"employed\" by the company to provide opponents to the paying gamers (Kaszor 2012)."
